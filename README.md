# Connect4 AI Challenge

## 🎮 Project Description

This Connect4 game includes several AI agents with different complexity levels, from simple to advanced:

- **Random AI**: Chooses moves randomly.
- **Greedy AI**: Picks the best immediate move.
- **Heuristic AI**: Uses evaluation functions for smarter decisions.
- **Minimax AI**: Employs the minimax algorithm with adjustable depth and randomness for optimal play.

You can play against all AIs as Player 1. You can also play against the Minimax AI as either Player 1 or Player 2. Additionally, you can watch AI agents (excluding Random AI) compete against each other in spectator mode.

---

## 🕹 Features

- Play against different AI opponents.
- Customize Minimax AI difficulty by adjusting search depth and random moves.
- Spectate AI vs. AI matches (Greedy, Heuristic, Minimax).
- Optionally enable move-by-move visualization by uncommenting `time.sleep(1)` in the code for a stepwise game view (best for low-depth AI).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
2. Run the main script to start the game.
3. Choose to play against an AI or watch AI agents play each other.

## 🎯 How to Play

- Take turns dropping discs into the columns of the board.
- Aim to connect four of your discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent does.
- Control gameplay through the interface or command line, depending on implementation.
